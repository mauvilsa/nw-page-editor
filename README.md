# Name

nw-page-editor - Simple app for visual editing of Page XML files.

Version: 2018.10.03


# Description

nw-page-editor is an application for editing ground truth information for
diverse purposes related to the area of handwriting text recognition (HTR).
The edition is done interactively and visually on top of images of scanned
documents. The format used for storing the ground truth information is based
on the [Page XML schema](http://www.primaresearch.org/tools/PAGELibraries),
but with a few minor [extensions](https://github.com/mauvilsa/pageformat). It
is available in two variants. The first variant is as a desktop application,
based on the NW.js framework thus making it cross-platform. The second variant
is as a web application that can be easily setup as a docker container.


# Desktop variant installation

Linux/Mac/Cygwin:

1. Download the NW.js package appropriate for your platform from
   http://nwjs.io/downloads. Extract it to a location where you store
   applications and add to your PATH the directory containing the nw/nwjs
   binary: root of package in Linux/Cygwin or nwjs.app/Contents/MacOS in OSX.

2. Move the nw-page-editor directory to a location where you store
   applications and add the package's bin directory to your PATH.

Windows:

1. Download the NW.js package appropriate for your platform from
   http://nwjs.io/downloads. Extract it to a location where you store
   applications and move or copy or clone the files of this repository such
   that package.json is in the same directory as nw.exe.

2. Create a shortcut to nw.exe to ease opening of the app. In windows it is
   not possible to open files directly from the command line.
